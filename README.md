Smarthome project files

My home automation project (based on Openhab2, MQTT, Arduino, Bash), used in production. 

Some source files contains sensitive information (user names, passwords, etc). The content of these files redacted, and files renamed to *.*_example. 
If you would like to test the configuration, you need to remove the "_example" endings from these files.
